# Auth + Authz Using Auth0

This is a small demo project to play around with Auth0 and authentication with authorization.

There are two different services:

- Express SSR Website
- **Express Items** API (this)

This example uses Auth0 for authentication and authorization between these two services. I'm following a YouTube video
made by the Auth0 team here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFitx8gf7rA>.

## Up and Running

Install `pnpm` and run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Make sure to run the SSR website as well, then access on <http://localhost:3000>.
